Final submission: Authentication issue unresolved  

Despite extensive debugging and multiple validation attempts, I was unable to determine the exact cause of the JWT authentication failure. The token is generated correctly, but it fails validation on protected endpoints. Given the time constraints, I am submitting the project as-is.  

Further investigation would be needed to trace where the token validation fails, potentially related to key encoding, claims parsing, or middleware execution.  

Submitting this version as my final attempt.
